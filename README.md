jQuery-ui-pic creates simple classes for jQuery UI icons.

They mirror the ```ui-icon``` classes but are simpler and can be used without additional jQuery UI stylesheets.

### Installation

The ```jQuery-ui-pic.css``` stylesheet needs to be in a folder under the same root as the ```img``` folder.

### Usage

The HTML markup:

```html
<i class="pic-trash"></i>
```

can be used within a link like so:

```html
<a href="#delete"><i class="pic-trash"></i> Delete</a>
```

### Images

You can use any sprites included in the jQuery UI; I have copied a few of them in this project.

### Credits

Thank you to [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) for the sprites and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) for the styles.
